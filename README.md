## What does "fore_Livish" do?

It tracks Foreign Exchange prices in a console, so you can do day-trading!
(It technically is supposed to be used for a bot though.)

In theory, I'd love to add things like graphs and logs. Although, I don't know
if I should do that until I can run the script 24/7 (which I can't do at the moment)
otherwise, it could create very large inconsistancies.


## Why "liveish"?

Because it's almost in real time, except it updates every few seconds because
of certain limits. I'd hate to accidentally DDoS this site if tons of people ran
this script.
